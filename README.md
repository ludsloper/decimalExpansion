#--Function list--

DONE *Simplify the denominator/numerator as much as we can <br />
DONE *Check if den is in (2^a)*(5^b) form <br />
DONE *Check if den is divisable by 2 and 5 <br />
DONE *Check for 10^k = 1(mod n), k=length of repetation, n=biggest prime divisor of den<br />
DONE *Find the biggest prime divisor of a number<br />
*iteratively find the repetition<br />

#IDEAS AND SHIT
*we can carry numerator and denominator around in an array. would be easy to reach and manipulate in functions<br />
*we should also plan for the cases where numerator is bigger than the denominator<br />
*** Lets just do 
x=0;   //x is the times we subtract the numerator by the denominator, this way we get n/d = integer+some n*/d where n*<d 
while(n>d)
x++
n-d

*we can also make it so that when the program is called like "repetitionFinder num den" in the command line, it automatically outputs the output<br />
